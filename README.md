# custom-betaflight-board
This repository contains a Betaflight board configuration that enables the use of an STM32F411 development board as a custom flight controller.

In this custom flight controller project, we will use the Blackpill STM32F411 development board together with a BMI160 IMU. Optionally, a buzzer and a voltage divider circuit can also be added for extra functionality such as battery voltage monitoring and low battery alerts.

We will use the BMI160 IMU sensor in SPI mode.

Let's build the circuit as shown in the image below.

* To build the Betaflight firmware, start by downloading the MSYS2 development environment from the following link: https://www.msys2.org/

* Once MSYS2 is installed, launch the MSYS2 UCRT64 terminal and run the following commands in order:

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S git make
cd c:
mkdir betaflight
cd betaflight
git clone --recursive https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight.git betaflight-4.5.2
cd betaflight-4.5.2
git checkout -b release-4.5.2 tags/4.5.2
make arm_sdk_install
```

* Once this command completes the download; Please reorganize the folder inside c:/betaflight/betaflight-4.5.2/tools named gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10 which currently contains another folder with the same name nested inside it. The final structure should be:

c:/betaflight/betaflight-4.5.2/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/c/betaflight/betaflight-4.5.2/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/bin
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

* Provided the gcc-arm-none-eabi folder has been properly reorganized, you will be able to verify its version.

* Paste the BLACKPILL folder inside the C:\betaflight\betaflight-4.5.2\src\config\configs path.
  
* After that, execute the following command;

```bash
make BLACKPILL
```

* After the build process completes, the hex file will be generated in the C:\betaflight\betaflight-4.5.2\obj folder.

* If everything is set, flash the hex file to the STM32F411 board using Betaflight Configurator.

* Download Betaflight Configurator for your OS from:

https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases

* Open the Configurator.

* Enter boot mode by holding BOOT while plugging the board into the PC, or if connected, hold BOOT and press RESET once.

* Go to Firmware Flasher tab, click Load Firmware (Local), and select the hex file.

* Click Flash Firmware to start flashing.
